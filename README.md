# Wordle Bridge

My friends and I share Wordle results in Discord, and every day my kids would ask me about these results.

This Discord bot is a quick toy project in which I learned how to make a Discord bot, and all it does is share results across two channels in different servers and do some auto-formatting to spoiler out stuff consistent with what we've been doing in our game.
